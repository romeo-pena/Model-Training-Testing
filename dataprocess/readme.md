# How to run:
1. Run `datalabelreduce.py` to reduce the labels from the cityscapes dataset
(we use the labelids images - grayscale images)
2. Run `resize_labels` to change the size of the images
3. Run `processlabels.py` to change the grayscale image into an image with color
4. Use `checkimage.py` to check if images in color directory are correct
