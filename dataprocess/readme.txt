How to run:
1. Run datalabelreduce.py to reduce the labels from the cityscapes dataset
(we use the labelids images - grayscale images)

2. Run processlabels.py to change the grayscale image into an image with color

3. Use checkimage.py to check if images in color directory are correct

TODO:
1: make json file that contains the classes and palettes for each class
